        <p [@fadeIn]="showP1 ? 'visible' : 'invisible'">
            Starting out at the age of 14, I never stopped learning new computer programming languages and skills.<br>
            Early on, I began working with Java to make simple applications that I found interesting and within a month I knew this was absolutely what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.<br>
            I wanted to learn more and expand my skills further.
        </p>

        <p [@fadeIn]="showP2 ? 'visible' : 'invisible'">
            I continued on to explore various different fields such as mobile app development, web development, and scientific computing.<br>
            There was a great sense of satisfaction in learning these different languages and seeing things from different perspectives in doing so.<br>
        </p>

        <p class="bold" [@fadeIn]="showP3 ? 'visible' : 'invisible'">
            My mission statement is to produce true utility through software.
