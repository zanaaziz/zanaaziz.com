        <p [@fadeIn]="showP1 ? 'visible' : 'invisible'">
            Starting out at the age of 14, I never stopped learning new computer programming languages and skills.<br>
			Early on, I began working with Java to make simple apps that I found interesting but within a month I knew this was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.<br>
			I was eager to learn more and expand my skills further.
        </p>

        <p [@fadeIn]="showP2 ? 'visible' : 'invisible'">
			I continued on to explore different areas of development in web, software, and scientific computing.<br>
			There was a great sense of satisfaction in learning different languages and gaining a new perspective each time.
        </p>

        <p class="bold" [@fadeIn]="showP3 ? 'visible' : 'invisible'">
            My mission statement is to produce true utility through software.
